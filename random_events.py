# 2: Plague: All nodes influence shrinks by between 25 and 75 percent
# 3: MCS (main character syndrome): 1/8 of current nodes have their influence increased every iteration until next event
# 4: City rezoning: Weights are redone with new random values
# 5: Alien Abduction: 1/8 of total nodes are removed from graph
# 6: Great Flood: Create MST and wipe away other weights
# 7: Prosperous Trade: add one edge to each node, unless at max, in which case multiply each edge by 1.25
